âThus far on my way to Italy. We have just passed the
                           âPisse-Vacheâ (one of the first torrents in Switzerland) in time to view the
                           iris which the sun flings along it before noon.

âI have written to you twice lately.Mr. Davies, I hear, is arrived. He brings the original
                           MS. which you wished to see. Recollect that the printing is to be from that whichMr. Shelleybrought; and recollect also, that
                           the concluding stanzas ofChilde Harold(those to mydaughter) which I had not made up my mind whether to
                           publish or not when they werefirstwritten (as you will see
                           marked on the margin of the first copy), I had (and have) fully determined to publish
                           with the rest of the Canto, as in the copy which you received by Mr.
                              Shelley, before I sent it to England.

âOur weather is very fine, which is more than the summer has
                           been.âAt Milan I shall expect to hear from you. Address either to Milan,poste restante, or by way of Geneva, to the care ofMonsr. Hentsch, Banquier. I write these few
                           lines in case my other letter should not reach you; I trust one of them will.

âP.S. My best respects and regards toMr. Gifford. Will you tell him, it may perhaps be as
                              well to put a short note to that part relating toClarens,merely to say, that of course the description does not refer to that particular spot
                              so much as to the command of scenery round it? I do not know that this is necessary,
                              and leave it to Mr. G.âs choice, as my editor,âif he will allow me to call him
                              so at this distance.â

  It is a month since the date of your last letterâbut you are not to suppose
                  that your letters do not arrive. All the assertions of the post being impeded are (I believe)
                  false; and the faults of their non-arrival are in those who write, (or rather do not write) not in
                  the conveyance. I have hitherto written to you very regularly, indeed rather perhaps too often, but
                  I now tell you that I will not write again at all, if I wait so long for my answers. I have
                  received no less than three letters from one person all dated withinthis
                    monthof Octr, so that it cannot be the fault of the post, and as to
                  the addressâI particularly statedGeneva, as usual poste restante, or to the
                  care ofMonsrHentschBanquier
                  Genevaâperhaps the latter is safest. I mention all thisânot from any wish to plague youâbut because
                    [my unfortunateeffaced] circumstances perhaps make me feel more keenly anything which looks
                  like neglect; and as among my faults towards you,thatat least has not been
                  one, even in that in which I am often negligentâviz.âletter writingâpray do not set me the example,
                  lest I follow it.
  
  I have written twice since my arrival at Milan and once before I left Geneva.
                  My Diodati letter contained some directions about my daughterAda, and I hope you received that letter & fulfilled my request as far as regards
                  my child. I wish also to know ifScropedelivered the things
                  entrusted to him by me, as I have no news of that illustrious personage. Milan has been an
                  agreeable residence to me, but we propose going on to Venice next week. You will address however as
                  usual (to my bankers) to Geneva. I have found a good many of the noble as well as literary classes
                  of society intelligent, & very kind & attentive to strangers. I have seen all the sights,
                  & last night among others heard an Improvisatore recite, a very celebrated one, namedSgricchi. It is not an amusing though a curious effort of human
                  powers. I276BYRON AND AUGUSTAenclose you a letter ofMonti(who is here & whom I know), the most famous Italian poet now living, as a
                  specimen of his handwriting. If there are any of your acquaintance fond of collecting such things
                  you may give it to them; it is not addressed to me.

  Your confidential letter is safe, and all the others. This one has cut me to
                  the heart because I have made you uneasy. Still I think all these apprehensionsâvery groundless.

                  whatever she may suppose or assertâI never âcommittedâ any one to her butmyself. And as to herfanciesâshe
                  fancies any thingâand every bodyâLady M1&c. &c. Really this is starting at shadows. You distress me withânoâit is notyou. But I have heard thatLady Bââis
                  ill, & I am so sorryâbut itâs of no useâdo not mention her againâbut I shall not forget her
                  kindness to you.

  I am going to Chamouni (to leave my card with Mont Blanc) and I mean to buy
                  some pretty granite & spar playthings for children (which abound there) for my daughterâand my

                  divide the rest among your own. I shall send them byScrope;
                  this goes by another person. I shall write more and longer soon.
  
  do not be uneasyâand do not âhate yourselfâ if you hate either let it bemeâbut do notâit would kill me; we are the last persons in the worldâwho
                  oughtâor could cease to love one another.
  
  P.S. I send a note toGeorgiana. I do
                    not understand all your mysteries about âthe versesâ & the Asterisks; but if the name is not
                    put asterisks always are, & I see nothing remarkable in this. I have heard nothing but
                    praises of those lines.

  As soon as I had read the third canto of âChilde Haroldâ myself, I
                                      had no hesitation in tellingMr.
                                          Kinnairdthat I should make my offer fifteen hundred guineas;
                                      but he has called to-day to say that two thousand are expected by your friends.
                                      I told him that hitherto, I believed that no one had impugned my estimations;
                                      and that with regard to yourself I had no other feeling than a desire to give
                                      all that was possible, and on the present occasion I thought I had anticipated
                                      any notions, and that I suspected the demand to be based rather on my own data
                                      than on any independent estimate. The poem, however, is so much beyond anything
                                      in modern days that I may be out in my calculation: it requires an ethereal
                                      mind, like its authorâs, to cope with it. He was so obliging as to ask
                                      for the additional Â£500 eventually; but I have preferred to settle it at
                                      once at the Â£2000âand now the Lord (not you) have mercy upon me!
                                      Remember I do stipulate for all the original MSS., copies or scraps.
  
  I am thinking more seriously than ever of publishing a monthly
                                      literary journal and am promised the contributions of the greatest characters
                                      here. If I succeed, I will venture to solicit the favour of your powerful
                                      assistance in the shape of letters, essays, characters, facts, travels,
                                      epigrams, and otherâto youâsmall shot, and to entreat the favour of
                                      your influence among your friends.

                             for certes, if one could foreseeâbut I wonât go onâthat is, with this sentence;
                             but poetry is, I fear, incurable. God help me! if I proceed in this scribbling, I shall
                             have frittered away my mind before I am thirty, but it is at times a real relief to me.
                             For the presentâgood evening.â

  Two days ago I wrote you the enclosed1but the arrival
                  of your letter of the 12thhas revived me a little, so pray forgive the
                  apparent âhumeurâ of the other, which I do not tear
                  upâfrom lazynessâand the hurry of the post as I have hardly time to write another at present.
  
  I really do not & cannot understand all the mysteries & alarms in your
                  letters & more particularly in the last. All I know isâthat no human power short of
                  destructionâshall prevent me from seeing you whenâwhereâ& howâI may pleaseâaccording to time

                  being so) left me in prospect in existence, and that I can bear the restâso that you remain; but

  My health is good, but I have now & then fits of giddiness, &

  Milan has been made agreeable by much attention and kindness from many of the
                  natives; but the whole tone of Italian society is so different from yours in England; that I have

  âI am thus far (kept by stress of weather) on my way back to
                             Diodati (near Geneva) from a voyage in my boat round the Lake; andI enclose you a sprig ofGibbonâsacaciaand some
                             rose-leaves from his garden, which, with part of his house, I have just seen. You will
                             find honourable mention, in his Life, made of this âacacia,â when he walked
                             out on the night of concluding his history. The garden andsummer-house,where he composed, are neglected, and the last utterly decayed;
                             but they still show it as his âcabinet,â and seem perfectly aware of his
                             memory.
  
  âMy route, through Flanders, and by the Rhine, to
                             Switzerland, was all I expected and more.
  
  âI have traversed allRousseauâsground with theHeloisebefore me, and am struck to a degree that I
                             cannot express with the force and accuracy of his descriptions, and the beauty of their
                             reality. Meillerie, Clarens, and Vevay, and the Chateau de Chillon, are places of which
                             I shall say little, because all I could say must fall short of the impressions they
                             stamp.
  
  âThree days ago, we were most nearly wrecked in a squall off
                             Meillerie, and driven to shore. I ran no risk, being so near the rocks, and a good
                             swimmer; but our party were wet, and incommoded a good deal. The wind was strong enough
                             to blow down some trees, as we found at landing: however, all is righted and right, and
                             we are thus far on our return.
  
  âDr. Polidoriis not
                             here, but at Diodati, left behind in hospital with a sprained ankle, which he acquired
                             in tumbling from a wallâhe canât jump.
  
  âI shall be glad to hear you are well, and have received for
                             me certain helms and swords, sent from Waterloo, which I rode over with pain and
                             pleasure.
  
  âI have finished a third Canto ofChilde Harold(consisting of one hundred and seventeen
                             stanzas), longer than either of the two former, and in some parts, it may be, better;
                             but of course on that I cannot determine. I shall send it by the first safe-looking
                             opportunity.
